# Python Guessing Game
A simple number Guessing Game in Python, wich consist of some basic Python Language concepts.
Feel Free to use it in what ever you want.

# How to Play
Basically, the program choose a number randomly and waits your guess. As you try to guess the number, the algorithm gives you some hints. Once you hit, you can try again or close. If you want to quit during the game, you just need to type "quit" or "exit" in the guess input, you just close the window.
That is it! Is a very simple game, but is it fun!

# Reasson
I am uploading some shelved projects and I am trainning my rusty skills in Python a bit. Therefore, this project is part of it.
